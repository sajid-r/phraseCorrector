0,Haha i was getting nauseous from it if that was your ingame experience that would have given a whole new level of Bloodborne ^^ 
0,After reading this I wholeheartedly believe you should let her go. You and her simply aren't compatible. She's looking for a committment and you're bent on avoiding it. You should figure out your committment issues before getting into a committed relationship. 
0,You can buy a mystery sampler from small batch and request them
0,Nihilum and LG are significantly better off in theory. I can't really think of a replacement for Ptr that would leave CLG in a better place than they were before. Cloud9 should be much better but you never know.
0,Your 16 bars seems to focus on introducing yourself rather than a life you think is worth living. I understand if you introduced yourself in a few lines that made sense to the theme such as the line I fear my life remains aimless I traded paper for a lane switch. That made sense to the theme because it could be used to tell the audience how you dont have a life worth living yet. But lines like If you fight me I'ma show hands and throw down on yo ass like the young motherfucking Sylvester Stallone has has a place for introducing yourself but not for the theme of a life worth living.
0,Trinus vr is amazing but it'd be cool to be able to just sit anywhere and play without turning the pc on it seems like a waste not making fully functional games for gc.
0,It's not your fault don't think that. Hey if this helps it does then if it doesn't well. At least I can talk about it. I shot my dog. I had him for 10 years. I can home from partying and it was New Years so I was going to shoot off my .40 so... Well I was loading it outside and I shot it off accidentally. Right into my dog. Me having about 5-7 tequila shots into me though if I go to sleep I would wake up and he would be okay. Well if I called a vet when I shot him I could have saved him. Or at least from his pain. So I woke up saw a dead dog in my yard i cried for hours. That old dog still had a few good years in him. That was my fault and you sitting on a little tiny mouse is more understandable than a man discharging a firearm into a shitzu. Don't feel to bad.

0,and what about all of the players who hit vr 14 after 1.6 but before the removal of them?
0,"I would be tempted to excuse myself to the bathroom every time so you don't piss him off because he's your boss with disgusting details for negative reinforcement purposes.

0,I can't answer better than Acquittal. I just want you to know that I think you made the right decision. Good luck ! 
0,I'd recommend if you have the time to get an account with Citibank and get the Citibank Plus transaction account - they have no fees on currency conversion or transfers and charge no international atm withdrawal fees. Been using them recently for my overseas trips pretty handy.
0,I'm just an ordinary collector like everyone else here. Frankly I think you and everyone else who do giveaways are awesome. It gives people who never had the chance to get these two to FINALLY get them. If I win cool. If I don't then it's cool that it ended up in the hands of someone here that also wanted WFT and Ike.
0,99.99% of the power is filtered on the motherboard before it reaches any core components. hence no crashing really shitty power supply will cause it to crash if its really bad I.E. bad caps in the PSU. good grammar and punctuation on the Internets dose not mean you're smart douche. 
0,Dodger's got a video on it on her Dexbonus channel and Sam has a video of it on his channel but yeah basically his visa is expiring. They have to go back to long distance for probably a year at least but I wouldn't worry about them. They seem like they're in it for the long haul.
0,well i think new ashe is good at killing tanks but i would just switch up the build i think ie staticpd is must have on ashe as first items and i would never switch them up then lwbc whatever feelsis better whatever is over and u feel in need never lw last item obv but there can be so many things changed up in ashe builds i hope to test this cuz im super hyped for new ashe :D
0,Oh i don't find those annoying or obtuse. That's on you friend. 
0,Extended wheelies have a tendency to starve one of the cylinders of oil if that's something you're into. Can't speak from experience but it was always warned of on the forums when I had mine. 
0,I'm a guy and I had no idea this was a thing guys did.
0,The fire escape is there. You hear wood splintering and look to see that a raptor has managed to break a hole in the top of the door just above the dresser. Its head pokes through then disappears. There's another thud and the dresser moves forward a few inches.
0,Mid twenties male rocking skinny jeanspants have a styled hair cut and generally make a strong effort to look good. Setting off gaydars for nearly 10 years. The kicker is my little brother is actually gay and he is all rugged macho man. 
0,How so? Importing of heroin - that is going to be cut with God knows what and pumped into the veins of addicted Australians is bound statistically to have caused at least one drug related overdose death. Is that drawing too long a bow? I think not. ...and the crime is treated in a similar way to murder - from a penalty perspective.
0,Definitely test a few. I was told as a beginner I would be happy with a 10 ft sit-on. But I have some boating experience and ended up with a 12.5 ft sit-in. I love the weight and the response time. And I can go a lot further in it. Splash splash! 
0,thanks for your contribution :3Ill still wait a little for more people helping me

0,He's not claiming a god exists. He's positing a god exists and he's positing that someone created him.
0,That's something you hear a lot from people when discussing huge builds like this especially with new vehicles. For starters the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn this is a hypothetical dream build after all why not get the one with the fanciest interior? Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers heavy duty axles and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand or better on axle swaps gear swaps skid plates locking differentials etc voiding warranty or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory. In the long run it's just cheaper to buy the Rubicon if you plan on doing a serious build. 
0,"Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears? We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action diversity quotas and scholarships that white people even ones as poor or poorer don't get. They don't want change. The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in and as a measurable consequence an increase in crime? The cause of their problems lie in two places: The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioterscriminals started taking responsibility for their actions made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. and I'm not saying this is how it should be it's just how it is "

0,'There are no bad tactics only bad targets' - some dumbass Getting mad ain't the problem its how that anger is expressed...which happens to be the same damn way every time. SJW is just a subset of entitled internet asshole.
0,On my Schalke save I'm using the same formation but retain possession short passing and work ball into box. Then against big teams and tough away games I go play narrower and exploit the flanks and against easier teams at home I go play wider. Whipped crosses Close down More Get stuck in on both. I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic. I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's bought Silva for the LB luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there. 
0,"As the great Alex James said ""A man with a Barbour jacket and a bottle of champagne is invincible"" - get the Barbour! It compliments your build the best and it's just an awesome jacket"

0,"I can see how that could easily go. People often rate for enjoyment. When you're at the end of that show you can be like ""Aw it's over? That's how they end it? Oh well I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show fuck! It's not even a 6 the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!"" I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score. Of course all of this is probably overanalyzing on my part but it probably went somewhat like that."
0,Holy shit I couldn't tell if some of those scenes were sped up or they were actually moving that fast. I need to watch more Martial Arts movies!
0,"i'm pretty sure the line is ""we ain't broke on tour"" because of the misconception that they had broken up despite tweeting that they hadn't in addition to tweeting ""we're going on tour"""

0,I would love it. Him or Byron Jones from Uconn. Our backfield would rush for 2500 yards easy between him and HydeBush. Not to mention Kap running the ball. 
0,Smoking tobacco. Went from shitty pall-malls to Marlboro to Turkish Silvers to American Spirits to hand-rolled to pipe before I decided I was going to die if I kept going.
0,hmm interesting events how many attends weekly ops? do you guys use modd? 
0,Very low level subtle mania. From my coworkers reactions I'd guess it's just efficient zombie mode. What I notice more often is that I'm physically tired. Still alert enough mentally. Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words. Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep. Waking up kind of sucks but when I first wake up the brain fog lifts right away. The next today today I'll go to bed earlier. That means I'll wake up in the middle of night. Once awake wide awake. But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off. Since I got more sleep I can stay up a long time the next day. And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening. Memory consolidation I still wonder about. Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less? Is my brain processing everything faster than normal and it just doesn't need any extra time? In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice. I get more done. And that's translated into spending more time at work. $$$ In terms of quality it's kind of blah. Blah before blah now but I feel less here.

0,Don't get me wrong as I'd love to give you a comprehensive well-written response but I have much more valuable ways to spend my time than to reply to your straw arguments and vitriol. Things like masturbating or watching the universe age. 
0,But that isn't what is going on. You keep saying throwing bricks or rocks. That is the least of Baltimore s problem. The violence isn't even against the police. It is against businesses and people predominantly white people. That is racism. None of it is justified. Just like the LA riots weren't I am white I am not a racist. I don't support racism.

0,oh.. Well sorry for the rage then. Also thank you for clearing it up and being so kind.
0,That's one reason for it but not the only one. The other major one is the increased incidence of forced sex  indoctrination between families.
0,Well no. It was in the middle of a study hall and I was in school. But still knowing my paranoid anxiety fits the two things I'd be transfixed on would be either getting her pregnant or catching a disease. 
0,VERY looking forward to Pollo Empire once Better Call Saul finishes it's sixth season!
0,Right the tens of thousands of people who installed their own all killed themselves. Electricity is only dangerous if you're stupid and don't follow the electrical code. Its very simple stuff that you can pick up if you're handy and can read. Do have a licensed electrician install the crossover switch as most municipalities require that.

0,"Honestly I don't have as much of a problem paying for Chroma's when they are for the base texture and not for a skin. The ""Blucian"" as I'll call it for now is one I want to get and will probably purchase at some point and feel the price is while above what I would say is worth the value of it what I will pay for this one in particular. However I do think it's worth looking into other ways of obtaining the Chroma's outside of RP purchases."
0,Yeah but 60% boards and the like have layouts that are of normal size just very minimal in all other aspects. What I mean is all the keys are about the same size and about the same distance from each other as larger more regular keyboards they just have fewer keys and lower profile casings etc. This keyboard looks like all the keys are smaller and not spaced out to compensate for the size meaning the whole layout is very compressed. Must be intended for mobileportable use.
0,Sounds to me like unprofitable businesses are finding anything to blame but themselves for their failures. Nah can't be. People who run businesses are all brilliant captains of industry incapable of failure right?
0,"I think the whole ""American politics are crazy"" thing came from the fact that they are relatively transparent and that we treat them half seriously and half as entertainment value and then export them to the rest of the world for the same purpose. If you have a modicum of understanding of how the American system works and who some of the major personalities are you can enjoy shows like the Daily Show. I'm sure satirical political programming exists in other countries but we've mastered the genre. Plus its like sports-- we can banter about how bad our team's draft picks were and how congressthe presidentthe democratsthe republicans are taking us to hell in a hand basket over a few beers. because when I read about some of the political sleaze that goes on in other countries that I never hear about I'm fascinated and amazed."

0,That means each of those teams will play two games back-to-back. This isn't a best of series like they normally do it's seeing which team can gather the most wins throughout the tournament. At least that's what I've gathered about it.
