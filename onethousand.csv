0,Nihilum and LG are significantly better off in theory. I can't really think of a replacement for Ptr that would leave CLG in a better place than they were before. Cloud9 should be much better but you never know.
0,Your 16 bars seems to focus on introducing yourself rather than a life you think is worth living. I understand if you introduced yourself in a few lines that made sense to the theme such as the line I fear my life remains aimless I traded paper for a lane switch. That made sense to the theme because it could be used to tell the audience how you dont have a life worth living yet. But lines like If you fight me I'ma show hands and throw down on yo ass like the young motherfucking Sylvester Stallone has has a place for introducing yourself but not for the theme of a life worth living.
0,Trinus vr is amazing but it'd be cool to be able to just sit anywhere and play without turning the pc on it seems like a waste not making fully functional games for gc.
0,It's not your fault don't think that. Hey if this helps it does then if it doesn't well. At least I can talk about it. I shot my dog. I had him for 10 years. I can home from partying and it was New Years so I was going to shoot off my .40 so... Well I was loading it outside and I shot it off accidentally. Right into my dog. Me having about 5-7 tequila shots into me though if I go to sleep I would wake up and he would be okay. Well if I called a vet when I shot him I could have saved him. Or at least from his pain. So I woke up saw a dead dog in my yard i cried for hours. That old dog still had a few good years in him. That was my fault and you sitting on a little tiny mouse is more understandable than a man discharging a firearm into a shitzu. Don't feel to bad.

0,Dodger's got a video on it on her Dexbonus channel and Sam has a video of it on his channel but yeah basically his visa is expiring. They have to go back to long distance for probably a year at least but I wouldn't worry about them. They seem like they're in it for the long haul.
0,well i think new ashe is good at killing tanks but i would just switch up the build i think ie staticpd is must have on ashe as first items and i would never switch them up then lwbc whatever feelsis better whatever is over and u feel in need never lw last item obv but there can be so many things changed up in ashe builds i hope to test this cuz im super hyped for new ashe :D

Importing of heroin - that is going to be cut with God knows what and pumped into the veins of addicted Australians is bound statistically to have caused at least one drug related overdose death.

0,Definitely test a few. I was told as a beginner I would be happy with a 10 ft sit-on. But I have some boating experience and ended up with a 12.5 ft sit-in. I love the weight and the response time. And I can go a lot further in it. Splash splash!

0,He's not claiming a god exists. He's positing a god exists and he's positing that someone created him.
0,That's something you hear a lot from people when discussing huge builds like this especially with new vehicles. For starters the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn this is a hypothetical dream build after all why not get the one with the fanciest interior? Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers heavy duty axles and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand or better on axle swaps gear swaps skid plates locking differentials etc voiding warranty or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory. In the long run it's just cheaper to buy the Rubicon if you plan on doing a serious build. 
0,"Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears? We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action diversity quotas and scholarships that white people even ones as poor or poorer don't get. They don't want change. The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in and as a measurable consequence an increase in crime? The cause of their problems lie in two places: The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioterscriminals started taking responsibility for their actions made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. and I'm not saying this is how it should be it's just how it is "

0,On my Schalke save I'm using the same formation but retain possession short passing and work ball into box. Then against big teams and tough away games I go play narrower and exploit the flanks and against easier teams at home I go play wider. Whipped crosses Close down More Get stuck in on both. I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic. I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's bought Silva for the LB luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there.

0,"I can see how that could easily go. People often rate for enjoyment. When you're at the end of that show you can be like ""Aw it's over? That's how they end it? Oh well I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show fuck! It's not even a 6 the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!"" I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score. Of course all of this is probably overanalyzing on my part but it probably went somewhat like that."

0,Very low level subtle mania. From my coworkers reactions I'd guess it's just efficient zombie mode. What I notice more often is that I'm physically tired. Still alert enough mentally. Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words. Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep. Waking up kind of sucks but when I first wake up the brain fog lifts right away. The next today today I'll go to bed earlier. That means I'll wake up in the middle of night. Once awake wide awake. But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off. Since I got more sleep I can stay up a long time the next day. And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening. Memory consolidation I still wonder about. Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less? Is my brain processing everything faster than normal and it just doesn't need any extra time? In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice. I get more done. And that's translated into spending more time at work. $$$ In terms of quality it's kind of blah. Blah before blah now but I feel less here.

0,Yeah but 60% boards and the like have layouts that are of normal size just very minimal in all other aspects. What I mean is all the keys are about the same size and about the same distance from each other as larger more regular keyboards they just have fewer keys and lower profile casings etc. This keyboard looks like all the keys are smaller and not spaced out to compensate for the size meaning the whole layout is very compressed. Must be intended for mobileportable use.

0,"I think the whole ""American politics are crazy"" thing came from the fact that they are relatively transparent and that we treat them half seriously and half as entertainment value and then export them to the rest of the world for the same purpose. If you have a modicum of understanding of how the American system works and who some of the major personalities are you can enjoy shows like the Daily Show. I'm sure satirical political programming exists in other countries but we've mastered the genre. Plus its like sports-- we can banter about how bad our team's draft picks were and how congressthe presidentthe democratsthe republicans are taking us to hell in a hand basket over a few beers. because when I read about some of the political sleaze that goes on in other countries that I never hear about I'm fascinated and amazed."

That was 5 years ago and I still think about it all the time wishing I had been able to do something. Let someone know that you're not okay. Police officers routinely see the worst that society has to offer and it's easy to lose yourself in the mess if you don't have the right coping mechanisms set up. My academy has stressed a lot about stress management and officer suicides and it's hard to think of how many officers turn their weapons on themselves.

Because by what you're saying there is nothing he can do. So why not just introduce himself? If she finds it weird then that's on her unless like I stated earlier he makes it weird. If he just introduces himself that's not weird nor should it ever be considered weird.

In essence you can subtract two steps from every EIO Conduit after the first time you make a Conduit.

Not unless they use their own pre-surgery or stick to the one they were assigned to at birth until they get surgery. trans person will look way more out of place under the current system. It's shown pretty universally that allowing trans people to use facilities necessary for them to live as their gender generally leads to an increase in quality of life. But lower it for others?

0,"When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night I could see what looked like to me the poster from The Exorcist. Now the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dancelumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot something nearby or by just biting down. Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish horrifying. The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting... The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there waiting watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away. I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that."

In other words they learn how to learn. In order to be comprehensible advanced subjects i.e. life skills require the above foundational knowledge.

0, stop perpetuating the myth that acceleration rotation or curvilinear coordinates mean you have to bring in general relativity. Maybe this is semantics but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of generalized relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times. For example a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.

0,As someone who just installed an AppRadio 4 as in literally just installed it yesterday I think it's probably a little premature to jump in. I'm happy with the AppRadio but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features. I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are PioneerAlpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea. Speaking of OEMs once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible. Unless you have a need I need Bluetooth for hands free I would suggest holding off for a few months to see how this plays out.

0,The best way to improve your practicing is to understand why you're trying to practice. What are you trying to achieve with this exercise? Are you trying to improve your speed and rhythm? Are you trying to memorize the scales perfectly? Are you trying to make sure each note is articulated and played correctly? When you struggle in practice take a moment to focus on one element of the exercise at a time. Just make sure you can play at that tempo. Then make sure you can hit the strings in the right sequence. Then fret the right notes. Then put it together. Yes it's muscle memory but you need to figure out where the problem is one piece at a time. Take apart the toaster one part at a time to see why it won't heat up your bagel anymore.

0,Hello guys I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point whenever I get a free character slot but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So time for the history mumbo jumbo. We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted. I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.  5% Birth rate A generous number and the least likely of the three but I figured I'd throw it in would leave the current population at 500000 in the year 505AC 3% Birth rate Average more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today would leave the current population at 300000 in the year 505AC 1% Birth rate A somewhat low number but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure would leave the current population at 100000 in the year 505AC Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed. Thanks!

0,Really like it! I was kind of surprised when my bf first asked me to do it because I couldn't imagine it being very enjoyable for him - but apparently he likes it when he almost can't breathe? I think it feels so good so I get a bit nervous that I'm getting a bit carried away when I start to grind which usually escalates to me basically just thrusting myself against his mouth as hard as possible but he'll always just push me off a bit if I get too into it takes a few breathes and then pushes me back on. I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that haha.

0,Northern California May - Sep on the beach 60F weekday 11am Most 'local' people are wearing sweaters even most joggers are wearing shirts. One can spot a Brit up to a 14 mile away. They are wearing nothing but their brand-new swim suits which still has creases. Drunk. Not 'buzzed' but obliterated. Burnt to a crisp. So much so that they literally glow. Most of them are very un-Britishly friendly. Many are eager to explain that compared to their homeland liquor is very cheap here. It's funny on one hand yet sad knowing that the rest of their 'holiday' will be spent nursing a 2nd degree burn.

0,IMO they failed on AOM on that point as well.. when i first logged in I saw the new island on the map and went straight there. I started doing quests starting with the ones from the docks until they eventually just ended and didn't give me any more. It was a bizarre feeling like I was clearly missing something. Why wasn't i getting any continuation quests to other parts of the island that i hadn't been to? eventually i googled AOM to find a writeup on what all there is to do in the expansion and low and behold there's a starter quest in freeport. As if i'm supposed to find that organically.. 
0,I'm am explicitly not saying one is better over another they both have different uses depending on data and power requirements.

Infact there is an xda post of someone who soldered the same antenna to their WiFi antenna inside their nexus 7 2012 and crushed a world record for farthest WiFi controlled drone flight including the own companies best results lol Link for those interested And yes the video you're streaming to your TV is being streamed over WiFi.

0,My university's grad division is causing a similar type of language requirement debacle right now. Grad students in my field are required to complete a foreign language requirement either via undergrad diploma or exam in the appropriate language department. Foreign students however cannot use their native language say Korean to fulfil this requirement nor can they use English which for them is a foreign language. So essentially grad division is requiring students from non-English speaking countries to be trilingual. 
0,So in this case since I just bought my True Blue membership no loyalty points yet - I can purchase a ticket on May 4  4PM for the Chelsea vs. West Brom match - is that correct? 
0,On the 0 to 5 vs 5 to 0 thing:You could declare a variable equal to currentTime -q. Then another one equal to that -1. getAttr -t will give you the value of an attr at a certain time. So do two of those at the different times you established and subtract them from each other. If the result is positive the value is going down and vice versa. I'm writing this on my phone I hope it makes some kind of sense. I can write this out better tomorrow if you think it's the right idea.

0,I'm not sure if your GF would be thinking this but make sure that she knows that none of the suicides were her fault or in any way related to any actions she may have done. I wanted to say that because one of my friends attempted to commit suicide in my case it was a happier story because she survived a couple of weeks ago and I had a massive breakdown and tons of guilty feelings because I wasn't there for her. It's important for someone to say that it's not your GF's fault but don't bring it up unless she's mentioned that she's feeling that way because otherwise it may be unnecessary. Best of luck with everything...I'm sorry your week has been so bad

0,But they are both theories. That's how science works. New evidence could come to light that totally changes how we see the world. You have to accept that our theories are just the best idea we have right now. They may never change drastically - I'm not saying I don't believe in ether of them obviously. It's just important to accept that science is slow process of building knowledge and evidence on top of each other. Being blind to the possibility that you could be even slightly wrong doesn't allow for progress. It's hubris.

0,On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day pretty much non-stop to varying degrees. It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments the standard battery of subclinical brainmess self-esteem anxiety codependent tendencies etc. trust issues communication issues jealousy envy fear and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future my relationships and my own feelings desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later. But at the end of the day I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work. I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting. I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner or to the world in general. At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't deny my emotional responses but I do try to filter them and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them and I don't always get it right but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone albeit gently and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss but I think I can get it right and I know it's worth trying.

0," People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want. If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle I'm going to throw out a simple point. People ought to be able but they should not ought to be inclined. 'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest randomly I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a real solution. Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you. The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'. I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that. I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case. It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins if people don't buy champs if people don't buy stuff then the game can't exist. For the record I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy argumentum ad hominem - ""argument against the man"" I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way. You are right in saying that without payments the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe I don't know. But it is free to many people and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay they are not mutually inclusive options. Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision. As such we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game. You purchased what you purchased your skins your champions your Rune Pages. You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money. Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on your or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard though? Of course not because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case millions of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you. If you stopped paying right now maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now it would change their minds at all? If I had spent 0 on this game I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's choice as to what they do with their money and if they do not choose to purchase skinschromasRiot Points then that is perfectly acceptable. So my overall point is that you are entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that not sufficient reason to say what you'd like but it is not because you 'bought' that right. It's not being an asshole to say your mind. Never said it was. It's not being a douchebag to complain. It could just be ignorance or stupidity or a temper or a bad day. Could be plenty of things. But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation. Going to Reddit? Sure that could make an impact people do take in views from here from time to time. But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"" then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant in this case. It's our right as the people who make the game what it is. You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now. And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced I'm gonna say ""Riot that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."". In other words you're self-entitled. Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this. ""Riot X as a concept has a lot of potential to work and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this. It offers Y Z Alpha and Beta which is great but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers too. I mean look at your skins and chroma packs they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it needs to be that high but if it can drop down in price it'd be a much more appealing offer."" Also you're talking about another game whose skins can cost 10.00 by themselves the majority of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League. If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games then might I point out the Pay-to-Play business model that World of Warcraft has? And it has micro transactions? Blizzard  Riot Games are apples and oranges just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons because it's not going to stand very well."

0, The guy in the basement has no obligation to try and keep the game balanced or stable or in any way satisfactory for the millions of existing owners of the game. and yet people still want modding capabilities ingrained into the game. Since Mojang the creator of a game that is owned by millions said they were going to add modding half a decade ago but have yet to deliver people looked to unofficial sources for their demands. The guy in the basement is free to be selfish and greedy with machine resources to achieve their effects and need not care if their mod breaks any other features of the game. People are also free to not download crappy mods. The guy in the basement is free to abandon his work at any time and not worry whether the game will survive into the future. So is Mojang. They don't have to forever keep updating their game. Mojang must take these things into account and it constrains what they can do and how they do it. If Mojang were to add official support and give a standard to which mods need to meet in order to effectively run in game the modders would build their mods around that. Doing otherwise would be like if you built a program and expected an operating system to conform to the program you made.
0,After three games in the new patch I've got to ask whether Octarine Core reducing the CD of Hand of Midas is intended and if it is is it OP? Situationally it seems like it's almost unstoppable especially in pubs. Imagine the enemy Bristleback having a 6 minute Hand of Midas an 18 minute Octarine Core and then massively outlevelling everyone in the game. Also why isn't there a chatwheel for 'Wait let me Mango!'?

0,i disagree with a lot of that any good striker Bader cant consistently take down outclasses him on the feet that would definitely be the case with Rumble i dont know if you know this but Rumble has great Takedown defense 85% and Davis couldnt do anything vs him I doubt Cormier will be able to just lie on him he might be able to take him down a couple times but its also going to be stand up fight and Cormier could actually win and would be a deserving champ unlike Bader imo out of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader

0,I don't ride anymore but I used to a lot growing up. I lived in Bellvue which is about 20minutes west of Fort Collins Old Town. There is a fantastic little state park there called Lory State Park which is just on the other side of Horsetooth reservoir if you already know the area. It is very horse friendly and lots of places to unload ect. There are a small amount of bikers and hikers weekends are busier of course. Pretty much any encounter I have had with folks there is great. Everyone knows the trails and trail etiquette and I've never had any issues. They do day passes or you can get a state park pass as well. I would highly recommend the area. Beautiful trails and not too far from town.

0,If you're at the end of the game you're most likely gonna need to do a another playthrough. Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:  Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled you'll miss many of her lines.  You will have to use all of the characters there's no way around it. In your next playthrough get to the top of each dungeon exit switch out all your characters and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.  Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.  Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.  Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.  You can try scanning every enemy you fight but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway. I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines and you shouldn't have a problem.

0, I have grown up around firearms and have a homemade range in a field out back i shoot a ton and have carried on my person around the house for the past 6 years or so. This does not make you prepared to use your gun defensively. It has almost zero bearing on how well you will fare in a real fight for your life. You need the stresses of training and the eye of a competent instructor to evaluate you and help you improve. I'm not saying you have to spend thousands of dollars at the top firearms schools in the nation but just find a decent two day course in your area and sign up for that. It will do wonders for you.

0,"In 5th edition your skills perception deception investigation etc don't use a point system to increase. The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score strength dexterity intelligence constitution wisdom charisma and your proficiency bonus. Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background. Your ability scores are generated when you make your character and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook but a quick google search should tell you how it works as lots of systems such as pathfinder and even older versions of D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school and take 4 six sided die roll them all drop the lowest die and add the rest together The ""bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about not the actual score itself and is determined by taking the score dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12 is a bonus of 1 but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 note always round down for this so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0 Now for each skill you take the appropriate ability score bonus associated with it ex wisdom for perception and the proficiency bonus if applicable and boom you have your total skill bonus"

0,I work on small accounts with a flat commission but I was taking advantage of the ability to upsell that none of the other salespeople in the company used or even knew about. My base commission is $500 which is high considering the volume that can be sold in a day but I upsold the customer to $2000 more than the usual $200 upfront cost. That $2000 was all my profit. So that's about the commission from 5 sales. The company has since eliminated the up selling option because of that sale.

But there's a big difference between the big important coming out conversations with close friends and the casual ""do you have a boyfriend"" ""no I date women"" ""cool"" conversations... When I was coming out to important people and it was new and a big deal I needed to hear that it was okay. But if I'm at a party and being introduced to someone and they find out and do the speech that's when it gets annoying. I never meant that my friends and family weren't allowed to react like that during the initial coming out situation. That's normal. I'm just saying you don't have to tell every single gay person you meet that it's okay they're gay..."
0,To be honest mods can go both ways as they can make players easier to spot in some environments but harder to spot in other ones. For example multicam shows up more in desert maps but hides well in forest settings. Another example would be pmc skins they make the player easier to spot due to a lack of camo but also makes it harder to tell if they're enemy or friendly. 
0,A lot of the characters are very off in the dub. Homura comes off as emotionless which she is distinctly not in the Japanese track and Kyoko sounds like Angelica Pickles which is VERY off from her character in Japanese. Madoka's voice actress comes off as more irritating than she does cute and you can tell that's what she is trying for. The only decent one is Sayaka and that's still several levels below the quality of her Japanese counterpart.

0,What I find most amusing about ignorant posts like this is that 90% of the changes rocking MS now were set into place in Ballmer's tenure. But in terms of presentation he was never a great sell same as Myerson. Nadella and Belfiore have the presenting chops to be more plausible footmen... ah duck it done typing on this shot windows touch keyboard and shut reddhubb app ill find my android tablet and finish this post frontmen. phew back on a usable small-tablet keyboard  reddit app The only thing that's changed is the perception of those guys at the top which is important for your regular joe - like the OP clearly - who judges by how plausible someone looks. It's why Yahoo has Mayer as CEO it's why a legion of US corporates are headed up by sharp-looking dudes in their 50's and it's why Apple wouldn't have been the Apple it is now without Jobs. Bald bug-eyed Ballmer with his sweat stains and strained nerd voice wasn't going to cut it as a frontman in this hyper-self-absorbed age however good his leadership skills were. And they were good despite his misses. Nadella has only just started putting his own stamp on the company and is currently riding high on Ballmer's legacy.

When I was Pre-K I was taught to tie my shoes I learned to read etc. What you get out of school is a combination of what you put in what others put in and the materials or intelligence among those involved. Case in point - I hated math at a younger age until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching. If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes I would probably have loved math previous to her. TLDR - A good teacher a good mentor is a big deal at any age.

0,Apart from all the in-game mechanics I want to test out the new client I'm running a horrible crappy toaster and I can manage to run the current PoE at around 20 - 30 FPS. From what I've heard the new client seems to be really promising and I want to make sure that it can run on crappy toasters too so people like me don't have problems running PoE and find the best optimization to do so. Edit : Also I forgot about removal of desync and the introduction of ping I'm from India which means horrible packet loss but I blame that on my ISP from sucking ass so my ping is always 150 - 200 ms even while using Singapore gateway this will to some extent allow me to test out how lockstep mode feels with high ping which maybe others won't be able to do? and whether desync is still the more viable option for players with high ping.

0,I just bottled my dry hopped saison yesterday! Granted I've only tasted the hydro sample but it tasted pretty bloody magnificent. Recipe: 8.5 Belgian Pilsner 3 Flaked Rye .5 oz Mosaic  30 .5 oz Motueka  15 1.5 oz Mosaic  30 min hop stand started chiller 15 min into stand 1 oz Motueka  30 min hop stand 1.5 oz Mosaic - Dry Hop 5 days 1 oz Motueka - Dry Hop 5 days Wyeast 3711 1L starter ABV: 5.4% OG  1.048 FG  1.007 The sample was super tropical fruit - lots of pineapple and mango with some earthiness and other exotic-tasting fruit that I can't place. I'm hoping that the yeast and rye spiciness will come through a bit more but if not it will still be damn tasty. It obviously depends on what you're going for but unless you want a tropical fruit bomb I'd use one of Citra Galaxy or Amarillo and pair it with hops that have complementary but not necessarily similar flavor profiles Nelson would be good. I actually used those three hops in an IPA and it was just a muddled fruit punch flavor. My experience in using hops with similar flavor profiles is that you have to be damn good with your hop schedules to get them to play nice together instead of becoming muddled.

0,Seconded on the natural food sources. I've had good luck with apple trees craft an apple combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod they only grow under trees but grow fast. I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up and then filling in underneath with logs I thinks it's prettier. For my carnivores I have pigs in with them. Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure. Or just move some in with a lasso. And of course all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them! Right click with an appropriate food and it feeds and heals them no need for potions. He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat. Admittedly I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes maybe because of their size. But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground. Best of luck!

0,No. Just no. How you calculate DPS is not up for debate. If youre trying to argue the value of burst DPS versus Sustained DPS i can at least try and understand your arguement. But what you just said and used as your examples is completely irrelevant and does not change anything. DPS is calculated over the average length of a fight. Longer fight lower DPS. Its that simple
0,The pearl-ex is done by hand whereas the UV is printed by my fancy printer. We try to line it up as best as possible but there's usually some discrepecny. You'd of course have to be looking for it with and without UV to notice hence why this is the first time in quite a while I recall seeing it brought up. Experimented with adding UV to the pearl-ex but its not nearly as crisp and decided against it. For any faintness: its printed using a high-quality printer and gives very consistent results. Might be a subjective thing. All the reviews say its the best OH UV by a landslide and ther's not much I can do to improve it. Although the new blues have different UV so there's that to look forward to

0,"In my foray into the professional world I've come to realize that no one really knows wtf is going on at any given time. It's just my experience but after watching companies run from the inside I can say I wouldn't be shocked in the slightest that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time the decision makers go with ""common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell even if they did look for that kind of research it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys. For example the medical field and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched. So yes ymmv but as much as we'd all love these things to be logical - especially concerning business decisions it's been my experience that it hardly ever is. "

0,Not true. You have it wrong. Tree on my house due to hurricane. I paid to get things fixed out of pocket and collect from insurance later. Same with when a main water pipe burst in the joint. I have not wrecked a car so i do not know but i know if it was toataled i would go get a new car and not sit around waiting for insurance. Same if my shit was all stole I would replace out of my pocket what i needed and collect from ins later.

0,"Girly don't worry about it. I just had another growth spurt at 21 and even my eyesight is still changing at 22.  which it should stop so I can finally get lasik...  When I was 16 I was about the same as you I had a small chest even though I was 5'4"" and 155. I hated my body a lot. And it was not a fun time. Do your best to eat healthy worry less about counting calories since 16 is a tricky age for controlling that. I'm not sure what you eat but I know I had to watch my sugar and salt intake personally. Try getting involved in some sports or something active. And ironically try not to worry about your body doing this. Try focussing on having fun if you're playing a sport and being healthy. Look at losing weight as a bonus. Taking care of yourself will make you feel 500% better even if you don't see results. Don't worry about your body Come to terms with the fact that you may never develop certain parts. People's bodies vary a LOT and some women simply don't have hips. And that's perfectly fine. I STILL don't have the bomb ass chest I dreamed of as a girl but I play up the parts I do love. And even if you DO get those hips if you're used to self-loathing you'll just find something else you hate about your body. You gotta learn to love what you got and be grateful it's not as bad as it could be. I know high school is a shitty time when you're surrounded by a lot of super skinny ladies some of which have everything physically that you don't. But please understand that it's not just you there are many other girls who didn't win that little lottery. And even the ones who did will get pervy stares from older men and be judged by their good looks. The grass isn't very green for either side. You've gotta learn to love who you are because you're stuck with it. Be the best version of you that you can be. And if all fails look forward to getting out of High School because life gets a lot more fun."

0,I'm not saying he was a good coach for you or that he is even a good NBA coach he is clearly a better college coach. I am says no the deck is stacked against in the NBA if you don't have players. Antonie Walker wasn't a bad player but he was in his early 20s and was the best player on the roster. How are you supposed to beat Jordan Bulls ShaquilleKobe Lakers and Spurs with a roster like that. My only point is it has nothing to do with college coaches and everything to do wthat th players. 
0,Watching this made me miss S2 so much it was so much fun :
0,He's not renaming the surface M2 it's an entirely different surface from M. M is the surface area of the part of sphere above z1. This is however not a very nice surface area to integrate over so we want to find a different surface area that is easier to integrate over. First Stokes theorem is used to get an integral over the boundary of the spheresection which is precisely the circle at z1. Clearly this is also the boundary of the disk at z1 so we can use Stokes theorem again to get the integral over this disk which is much easier to calculate. First of all the n in this case is 001 so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second the area of a disk is easy to calculate so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well. To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object also has to come out and since the field is pointed upwards every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same.

I'd love to see a game with his name on it and I thought Silent Hills would be perfect for him but it seems he just can't get get going in the games industry.

0,"100k is a 10% deposit on a million dollar loan. It's why the grants are shit the govt gives you say $7000 but that instantly lets you borrow $35000-$105000 5-30% deposit more than you would have if not for the grant. Disclaimer: I've used the grant but didn't let it increase my budget because I'm not a moron. Loans are already too easy to get anyway.

The point I was trying to make was that I feel people are generally less tolerant of smoking then they are of something like car exhaust which is equally dangerous and unpleasant. I think that when talking about restricting social rights and freedoms only the danger to other people should be taken into account. I don't agree with the line of thinking of ""I'm willing do put up with the danger of X activity because I do it or sympathize with it but think that the equally dangerous activity of Y should be illegal because I don't sympathize or agree with the choices of people who do that."""

Just like he might point out places of water damage inside the attic or on the ceiling it's your job to investigate further if the roof condition is of an acceptable state to you. He pointed out the efflorescence it's up to you to decide if that's important to you to investigate further. He did his job he pointed out the efflorescence. It was up to you to act on the information he provided do further investigation if warranted by you.

Teachers not so much.

0,No. It's not so much an active dislike so much as disinterest. The texture doesn't bother me I just find the flavourlessness undesirable. Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother? I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty but could have been better applied to chicken where they blended and complemented the flavour. I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat. I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons but since it's a similar soft mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable. I eat meat so I have no reason to turn to tofu and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking where it offers significant advantages over meat.

0,"It sounds like you know what's best. Btw you likely didn't fail him. It's very normal for pits to have prey drive and it's very normal for pits to ""turn on"" around his age. Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive. My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours every single day without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes I took her to stores I took her everywhere. Didn't matter little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part. You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them. I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision. Lastly I hate to judge you on appearances but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life. This is probably just about the worst breed to own for someone like that. Good luck with whatever you choose. "

Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and ""knit"" when you are feeling anxious or judged but if you keep them flat or slightly arched you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS.
